# 🚀 Mark 100: Project Euler in C by Advaith "GeneralMing" Vasisht

Welcome to **Mark 100**—your one-stop showcase of elegant, efficient, and (sometimes eccentric) C solutions to Project Euler problems.
I’m **Advaith Krishna Vasisht**, a.k.a **GeneralMing**, tinkering my way through math, logic, and performance.

## 🎯 What’s Inside

* **100+ Project Euler challenges** solved in crisp, organized C files:

  * Format: `p001.c`, `p002.c`, … up through triple digits.
  * Each file prints both the correct answer *and* (if measured) execution time.
* **Straightforward, highly-commented C code**:

  * Step-by-step breakdowns of the math behind each solution.
  * Performance notes: “took X milliseconds on my Intel i5-7th Gen.”
* **Read-optimizable structure**:

  * Simple `Makefile` ready for `make pNNN`.
  * Use-case: compile enough or all — `make all`.

## 🛠️ Build & Run

```bash
git clone https://github.com/GeneralMing/project_euler_solutions_in_C.git
cd project_euler_solutions_in_C
make p042       # build and run problem #42
make all        # compile & run everything
```

Each program outputs the problem number, answer, and runtime. For example:

```
Problem 042: 162
Time taken: 0.0012 seconds
```

## 🎓 Why This Repo?

* **Perfect for learners**: Clear C implementations demystifying algorithms from primes and factorials to dynamic programming and recursion.
* **Speed buffs rejoice**: Easily spot performance bottlenecks and improve with better structures, faster libraries, or threading hacks.
* **Fun math + coding combo**: Explore elegant number tricks and real-world code execution—balanced brain-stretching between theory and practice.

## ⚙️ Typical Workflow

1. Select a target: “I want to solve Euler #125 today.”
2. Try it on your own—for fun!
3. Compare your approach with the existing `p125.c`.
4. Benchmark: “How fast is your prime-sieve versus mine?”
5. Propose improvements or a cleaner math insight? Open a PR! 💡
