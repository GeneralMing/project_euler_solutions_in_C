# Mark 100
A collection of General Ming's C program code to solve as many Project Euler's problems as possible .

Every solved problem has a program written in C. The source code requires almost no modification as it tends to execute if you have the proper requirements.

The code contains comments inside which suggest as to how the problem was solved. They also note the time taken to execute the code. 

The compiler used to compile the source code was GNU Compiler Collection for C. All code was run on a machine with Intel i5 7th generation with an AMD GPU. The language used to code was C11.
